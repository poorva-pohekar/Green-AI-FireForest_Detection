# FOREST FIRE DETECTION USING CV
This Project implements "forest fire detection" using computer vision technique to analyze images or videos and identify potential wildfire outbreak,

## Features:
- Real time fire detection from images or videos.
- Pre-trained deep learning model for accurate detection
- Image preocessing and Thresholding to detect fire regions.
- Alerts and Notifications can be integrated for real-world application.

## Installation:
bash-
pip install -r requirements.txt

Required Libraries:
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Streamlit(for web deployment)


## Future Improvements:
- Integrate Drone-based fire detection
- Deploy as a mobile app for quick alerts
- Improve accuracy using advannced deep learning models
- Implement cloud-based alert system
